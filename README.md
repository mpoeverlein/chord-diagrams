# chord.py

There are multiple ways to represent relationships between two elements in a set of elements. 
In some scenarios, chord diagrams are great way of visualizing those relationships!
In a chord diagram, the elements are represented as arcs along a circle and the relationships as connecting curves.
This repository provides a simple, but powerful way of constructing chord diagrams with the python package matplotlib!

A simple chord diagram with random interactions can be created in the following way:

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
